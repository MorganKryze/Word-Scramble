# Word-Scramble
# Introduction
The Word Scramble Game opposes two players on different boards. 
The main goal is to find the most words on each board in the shorter amount of time. 
The words can be placed horizontally, vertically and on the diagonals.
One must know that the size of each board increases as the amount of words hid in the board.
The scores are given at the end of the game.
Good luck !
